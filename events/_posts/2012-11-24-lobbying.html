        Each year governments of EU member states spend between 9 and 26 per cent of GDP
        on private contracting. Private contracts on public services such as infrastructure
        or health care are recorded in the European tender register. <a href="http://opented.org">OpenTED.org</a>
        has scraped, parsed and released procurement data

        <p>
        on 700,000 contracts from 2006 to
        2011. Join us for a deep dig into this bulk of procurement data. We expect investigative
        stories on no-bid contracts, government outsourcing trends and what companies
        benefitted from the Greek public construction boom before the crisis.
