    One promise of open data is that it will help us to find new
    ways to understand and respond to the world we live in. This
    is a big promise, but we want to find modest and meaningful
    ways to make good on it.
    </p>
    <p class="teaser">
    Weâ€™ve decided to start a series of week-long sprints, convening
    small teams of domain experts, data wranglers and developers
    to create useful data-driven applications that help to answer
    questions and unpack issues in a variety of different areas.
