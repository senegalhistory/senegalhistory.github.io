Labs member [Daniel Lombraña González](http://twitter.com/teleyinex) has built a [3-d globe showing the locatoins of urban parks around the world](http://teleyinex.github.com/pybossa-urbanpark-globe/) as located by volunteers using the [Pybossa Urban Park geocoding app](http://pybossa.com/app/urbanpark):

### Background

The Urban Parks geo-coding application is a micro-tasking app running on [PyBossa](http://pybossa.com). In the app volunteers are asked to find an urban park for cities around the world. The volunteers use a web map to browse the city, and then submit an answer: the coordinates of the urban park by placing a marker in the map, or saying: I don't find any park.

More details about PyBossa can be found on the official site <http://pybossa.com> and also in the <a href="docs.pybossa.com">online documentation</a>.
