How EU money is spent is an issue that concerns everyone who pays taxes to the EU. As the influence of Brussels lobbyists grows, it is increasingly important to draw the connections between lobbying, policy-making and funding. Journalists and activists need browsable databases, tools and platforms to investigate lobbyistsâ€™ influence and where the money goes in the EU. Join us and help build these tools!

Open Interests Europe brings together developers, designers, activists, journalists and other geeks for two days of collaboration, learning, fun, intense hacking and app building.
