Making sense of massive datasets that document
the processes of lobbying and public procurement at European Union level
is not an easy task. Yet a group of 25 journalists, developers, graphic
designers and activists worked together at the <a
href="http://okfnlabs.org/events/hackdays/lobbying.html">Open Interests
Europe</a> hackathon last weekend to create tools and maps that make it
easier for citizens and journalists to see how lobbyists try to
influence European policies and to understand how governments award
contracts for public services. The hackathon was organised by the
European Journalism Centre and the Open Knowledge Foundation with
support from Knight-Mozilla OpenNews.</p>
<p>
At the Google Campus Cafe in Londonndon, one group dived into European
lobbying data made available via an API: <a
href="http://api.lobbyfacts.eu/">api.lobbyfacts.eu</a>. Created by a
group of five NGOs: Corporate Europe Observatory, Friends of the Earth
Europe, Lobby Control, Tactical Tech and the Open Knowledge Foundation,
the API gives access to up-to-date, structured information about persons
and organisations registered as lobbyists in the <a
href="http://europa.eu/transparency-register/">EU Transparency
Register</a>. The API is part&nbsp;of lobbyfacts.eu, a website that aims
to make it easy for anyone to track lobbyists and their influence at
European Union level, due to launch in January 2013.</p>
<p>
One of the projects Createdd with the lobby register data is a map
showing the locations of the offices of lobby firms based on their
turnover. The size of the bubbles on the map corresponds to the turnover
of the firm. Built by <a href="https://twitter.com/pudo">Friedrich
Lindenberg</a>, the map is an overlay of a Stamen Design map with
Leafletjs.</p>

Other teams focused on data analysis, comparing the data from the EU
Transparency Register with that of the <a
href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fec.europa.eu%2Ftransparency%2Fregexpert%2F&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNE2JbDkGcyojnufFa8-lw8sMFEpyA">Register
of Expert Groups</a>. Interesting leads for possible further
investigative work resulted from the comparison of the figures reported
by lobby firms in the Transparency Register with those collected by the
<a
href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.nbb.be%2Fpub%2Fhome.htm&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNEOiiu39BbbE6C8eJF7FI_8J1vT9Q">National
Bank of Belgium</a>. &ldquo;Some companies underreported massively to
the National Bank of Belgium and some of them were making themselves
look bigger in the Transparency Register,&rdquo; said Eric Wesselius,
leader of the lobby transparency challenge and co-founder of <a
href="http://corporateeurope.org/">Corporate Europe Observatory</a>.
Wesselius&rsquo; organisation will continue investigations in this
area.</p>
<p>
A second group of journalists and graphic designers led by Jack
Thurston, an activist involved in <a
href="http://fishsubsidy.org/">Fishsubsidy.org</a>, discussed how fish
subsidy data could be used for finding journalistic stories and explored
various ways in which the unintended consequences of the EU fish
subsidies programme, such as overfishing, could be compellingly
presented to the general public. &nbsp;</p>

A theyhird group looked into European public procurement data.
&ldquo;Public procurement is an area that is underreported by
journalists,&rdquo; said data journalist Anders Pedersen, founder of <a
href="http://opented.org/">OpenTED</a>. &ldquo;9-25% of the GDP in the
EU is procurement - highest in the Netherlands where it is around 35%.
It&rsquo;s a real issue in times of austerity who provides our
services,&rdquo; he added.</p>
<p>
Several <a

were built to access the data relating to winners of contracts and the
values of these contracts from the EU publication <a
href="http://ted.europa.eu/TED/main/HomePage.do">TED</a>&nbsp;(Tenders
Electronic Daily). A map of public procurement contracts by awarding
city was created using Google Fusion Tables by geocoding the original
CSV file, enriched with OpenStreetMap.</p>

<p>
Pedersen&rsquo;s long term goal is to create an interface and an API for
EU public procurement data and to publish some more visualisations.
&ldquo;A lot of the work that got done here [at the hackathon] we would
not have gotten done in the next months maybe. It really helped us push
far ahead in terms of ideas and in terms of getting stuff
done.&rdquo;</p>
