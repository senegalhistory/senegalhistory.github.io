We're having the next Show and Tell on Friday, [26 October at 2:30 pm BST][time] via Google Hangout on Air. As usual, the URL will be posted on [OKFN Labs' G+ Page][gplus].

If you'd like to present, add your name to [the list][opad]. Remember, [#okfn on irc.freenode.net][irc] will be the backchannel for discussion and questions, so don't forget to hang out there.

### What's Show and Tell?
Have you built some cool tech you want to show everyone? Played around with some data? The Labs Show and Tell is your chance to share it with the OKFN Labs community! You get 2 to 5 minute to show us what you built!

### Missed the last one?
On Oct 12, 2012, we had the first Labs Show and Tell. Here's what we talked about:

#### [Scientific Promiscuity][sp] - Michael Bauer
Scientific papers are rarely written by a single person. Usually many authors come together to work on a specific issue. This visualization uses data obtained from Pubmed to show collaboration between authors.

#### [Activity API][activityapi] - [Code][activityapicode] - Tom Rees
Activity API scrapes through multiple data sources and creates one single PostgreSQL database with all the data. It scrapes through GitHub, Twitter, mailing lists posts, and Twitter.

#### [Dashboard][db] - [Code][dbcode] - Tom Rees
The OKFN Community Dashboard provides an overview of community activity. We have a flourishing and diverse set of activities and it can be hard, even for people 'inside' to see what is going on. The Dashboard helps us see quickly what is going on.

#### [nomenklatura][nk] - [Code][nkc] - Friedrich
A lot of time in data wrangling is spent making mappings of variant names to a canonical form. This app provides an easy-to-use, web-based method for creating such mappings, to allow for a more managed data cleansing pipeline.

#### [Messy Tables][mt] - Friedrich
A library for dealing with messy tabular data in several formats, guessing types and detecting headers.

#### [froide][fro] - stefanw
Froide is a Freedom Of Information tracker. The name comes from Freedom of Information (de). Also Froide sounds like Freude which is German for joy.

#### [PyBossa on Travis CI][travis] - Nigel
PyBossa now uses Travis CI for continuous integration. Makes reviewing pull requests easier since we can see test status right away.
