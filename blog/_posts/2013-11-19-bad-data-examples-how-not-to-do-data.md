We’ve just started a mini-project called [Bad Data][1]. Bad Data provides real-world examples of how *not* to publish data. It showcases the poorly structured, the mis-formatted, and the just plain ugly.

This isn’t about being critical but about **educating**—providing examples of how **not** to do something may be one of the best ways of showing how to do it right. It also provides a source of good practice material for budding data wranglers!

Each “bad” dataset on gets a simple page that shows what’s wrong along with a preview or screenshot.

We’ve started to stock the site with some of the better examples of bad data that we’ve come across over the years. This includes machine-*un*readable [Transport for London passenger numbers from the London Datastore][2] and a classic "[ASCII spreadsheet][3]" from the US Bureau of Labor Statistics.

**We welcome contributions of new examples! [Submit them here][6].**
