## New data

New data contributed over the last couple of months is now validated and live - this includes new data for **Switzerland, Greece, Brazil and the US**. Huge thank-you to contributors here including Hannes, Charalampos, Augusto and Todd.

We also have pending data for Italy and China to get in once it has been reviewed, and we have data in progress for Canada!

We'd love to have more data - if you're interested in contributing see <https://github.com/okfn/publicbodies#contribute-data>

## Updated Schema for Data

Thanks to input from James McKinney and others we've [reworked the schema][rework] quite extensively to match up as much as possible with the Popolo spec. You can see the new schema in the [datapackage.json][].

[rework]: https://github.com/okfn/publicbodies/issues/29
[datapackage.json]: https://github.com/okfn/publicbodies/blob/master/datapackage.json#L13-L105
