This is the first of regular updates on Labs project <http://data.okfn.org/>
and summarizes some of the changes and improvements over the last few weeks.

### 1. Refactor of site layout and focus.

We've done a refactor of the site to have stronger focus on the data. Front page tagline is now:

> We're providing key datasets in high quality, easy-to-use and open form

Tools and standards are there in a clear supporting role. Thanks to all the suggestions and feedback on this and welcome more - we're still iterating.

### 2. Pull request data workflow

There was a nice example of the pull request data workflow being used (by a complete stranger!): <https://github.com/datasets/house-prices-uk/pull/1>

### 3. New datasets

For example:

- US house prices <http://data.okfn.org/data/house-prices-us>
- Annual consumer price index <http://data.okfn.org/data/cpi>

Looking to contribute data check out the instructions <http://data.okfn.org/about/contribute#data> and the outstanding requests: <https://github.com/datasets/registry/issues>

### 4. Tooling

- We have a DataPackage.JSON creator tool in progress at http://data.okfn.org/tools/dp/create ([here's the relevant github issue][1])
- We have a new [data package viewer created by James Smith][tools]

### 5. Feedback on standards

There's been a lot of valuable feedback on the [data package and json table schema standards][standards] including some quite major suggestions (e.g. substantial change to JSON Table Schema to align more closely with JSON Schema - thx to jpmckinney)

[standards]: http://data.okfn.org/standards

### Next steps

There's plenty more coming up soon in terms of data and the site and tools.

- Complete the [datapackage.json generator][1] (support for gdocs especially)
- Complete the [datapackage.json validator][2]
- More [datasets especially key indices][3]
