    <h2>Just hangout (or observe from a distance!)</h2>
    <p>That's OK, we understand you may want to get a feel of how things operate before you dive in ;-0. If you want to start out dipping your toe in the water we suggest:</p>

      <li><a href="/contact/">Joining the mailing list</a> &ndash; and say hello, we'd love to hear from you!</li>
    </ul>

    <p>You can also get a sense of what folks are up to by taking a look at the <a href="/projects/">Projects</a> or the <a href="https://github.com/okfn/ideas/issues">Ideas List</a> (especially the <a href="https://github.com/okfn/ideas/issues?labels=In+progress">in progress ones</a>).</p>

    <h2>Jump straight in!</h2>

    <p>Why not just jump straight in :-) &ndash; there's loads of cool stuff to do! Not sure about something, or just want to chat with someone just <a href="/contact/">get in touch</a>. <strong>Already have something you're working on you'd like to share? We'd be delighted to hear about it &ndash; hop on the <a href="/contact/">mailing list or send us a tweet</a></strong>.</p>

      <h3 style="margin-top: 0;">Meetups</h3>
      <p>There are also plenty of chances to meet up with others both "in real life" or online &ndash; if that face-to-face stuff is just too much for you ;-)</p>
      <ul>
        <li><a href="/events/hangouts/">Come to an online hangout</a></li>
        <li><a href="/events/open-data-maker/">Come to an open data maker party (or start one up!)</a></li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Note!</strong> we currently do a somewhat shocking job of keeping the events list up to date so, at the moment, the above is <strong>unlikely to accurately reflect the past, or, more importantly the <em>future</em></strong>. Its therefore better, at present, to join the <a href="/contact/">mailing list and keep an eye on twitter</a>. (Even better why not volunteer as our calendar Czar and help us keep the above more up to date!)</p>
