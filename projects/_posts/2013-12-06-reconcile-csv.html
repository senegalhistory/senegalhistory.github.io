Reconcile-CSV is an OpenRefine reconciliation
service running on top of a CSV file. It uses fuzzy matching to find the
most likely candidates for matching. 

If you ever needed to join two datasets that didn't have unique identifiers
and where things are written slightly different: this is a way to go.
