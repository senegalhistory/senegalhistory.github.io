<p>Nomenklatura is a simple service that makes it easy to maintain a canonical list of entities such as persons, companies or event streets and to match messy input, such as their names against that canonical list â€“ for example, matching Acme Widgets, Acme Widgets Inc and Acme Widgets Incorporated to the canonical "Acme Widgets".</p>

<p>With Nomenklatura its a matters of minutes to set up your own set of master data to match against and it provides a simple user interface and API which you can then use do matching (the API is compatible with Open Refine's reconciliation function).</p>

<p>Nomenklatura can not only store the master set of entities you want to match against but also will learn and record the various aliases for a given entity - such as a person, organisation or place - may have in various datasets.</p>
