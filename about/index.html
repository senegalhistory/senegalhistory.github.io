<h1>What is Labs?</h1>

<p>
<span class="minipic-wrapper"><img class="chaos minipic" src="/img/chaos.png"></span>
<p>We're a community of civic hackers, data wranglers and ordinary citizens intrigued and excited by the possibilities of combining technology and information for good &ndash; making government more accountable, culture more accessible and science more efficient.</p>

<p>We focus on making things - whether that’s apps, insights or tools. We have a strong preference for <a href="http://opendefinition.org/">open data</a> and <a href="http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html">free</a> / <a href="http://opensource.org/">open source software</a>.</p>
</p>

<p>
We're part of the <a href="http://okfn.org/">Open Knowledge Foundation Network</a> and operate as a collaborative community which anyone can join.</p>

<p>You don't need to be an uber-geek to participate: interest and a willingness to get your hands dirty (digitally) be that with making, testing or helping is all that's needed - though we do allow lurking on the <a href="/contact/">mailing list</a> ;-).
</p>

<h2 id="principles">Principles</h2>
<p>We have some simple community principles that outline how we function and
which act as a guide for community members.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Openness</strong>: <a href="http://opendefinition.org/">open
data, open content</a>, and <a href="http://opensource.org/">open tools</a>. In
Labs we only make open stuff. We also have a strong preference for
<em>using</em> open stuff but we aren't obsessed about this &ndash; if Excel or
Google Docs or [insert tool] is what you use to get the job done that's
ok!</li>
  <li><strong>Positive and welcoming</strong>: We're friendly to newcomers and old hands alike.
Everyone was new once (and sought to reinvent the wheel!). Enthusiasm and
support for others at all levels of skill and experience is important.</li>
  <li><strong>Doing</strong>: we're focused on the concrete not the abstract, making not
theorizing.</li>
  <li><strong>Insights as well as apps</strong>: insights, analysis, and
stories may be just as valuable as the tools and the apps.</li>
  <li><strong>More than code</strong>: designing, testing, documenting, wrangling are
just as valued as coding.</li>
  <li><strong>Informal</strong>: we don't get caught up in formal processes or hierarchies. We
only have process where its essential, or authority where it matters such as
access to limited resources, management of shared infrastructure</li>
</ul>


<h2 id="governance">Governance and Roles</h2>

<p>Whilst anyone can participate in Labs without formally signing up, you can
self-identify as an official <a href="/members/"><strong>"Member"</strong></a>
as a way to show you are part of the community. Anyone may become a member: <a
  href="/members/">just sign-up</a>!</p>

<p>We also have a special category of <strong>"(Official)
  Contributors"</strong> and <strong>"Leads</strong>. Official Contributors are
members recognized for their contributions in Labs and more widely.
Contributors are entitled to certain privileges, for example in relation to use
of <a href="/about/resources/">resources</a> or in featuring projects on the
site. More detail about contributors can be found below.</p>

  <li>Managing and delegating access to things like twitter, website etc</li>

<h2 id="faqs">FAQs</h2>

<h3>Is there a fee for being a Member or a Contributor?</h3>
<p>Simple answer: no - there's no fee and we do not plan to have
one. It is possible that at some point in the future we may
want to think about this as a way to defray the costs of infrastructure if
these get too large (there would be a full community discussion on the matter
if this ever did come up). However, our hope is that simple donations will
suffice &ndash; and if you are able to donate money or make an in-kind
contribution (e.g. servers) we'd <a href="/contact/">love to hear from
  you</a>.</p>

<h3>How is Labs resourced?</h3>
<p>Labs is community based and run and its activities and management is done by
its members. As such there are no staff costs. Infrastructure such as hosting
and storage are provided and managed on an ongoing basis by the Open Knowledge
Foundation with contributions from the community.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.shuttleworthfoundation.org/">Shuttleworth
  Foundation</a> provided financial support to set up Labs and maintain
infrastructure. We gratefully acknowledge this support and would like to say a
huge thank-you to the Shuttleworth Foundation for their support here.</p>
