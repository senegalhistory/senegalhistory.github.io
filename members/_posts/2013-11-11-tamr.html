I had my postgraduate degree in Data Mining and Information Retrieval at the University of East Anglia. I am trying to challenge the old saying, "Jack of all trades, master of none". I have about 10 years experience in Software Development. In previous lives I used to work as an Information Security Consultant and Presales Manager. I also have been volunteering in Global Voices Online (GVO) since 2007, and currently I am local ambassador of the Open Knowledge Foundation (OKFN) in Egypt. Words like Open Data, Government 2.0, Data Visualisation, Data Journalism and Social Startups are like music to my ears.
